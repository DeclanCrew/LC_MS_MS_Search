# LC_MS_MS_Search
Tandem mass spectrometry search engine for usage in bioinformatics, based of MASCOT algorithm.


Requires numpy for array handling, and biopython for parsing of protein sequences

To run, set configuration options as wanted in mascotStyle.cfg and then run mascotStyle.py.

This is still in an early beta, so it may not work on all systems.
